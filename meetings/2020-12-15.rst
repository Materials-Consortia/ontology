Meeting December 15, 2020
=========================

- With James Hester present, the discussion naturally started on features of the CIF standard and thoughts on how our effort relates to the ontology-related work of the IUCr.
  A context for this was a previous discussion on how an ontology for materials databases relates to / should be positioned to the work of IUCr and the crystallography domain of the EMMO.

  * Discussion on the degree to which relationships are/can be represented in the CIF format (and thus the implicit ontology of that standard)
  
    - The CIF format is, at its core, "a dictionary" with carefully defines entities that can have values (single values, tables, etc.) 
      
    - The definitions of these data values describe relations between them, but there is no explicit machine-readable representation of relations.
      
  * Some discussion about if the CIF standard "is an ontology" and what an ontology is.
    There is no agreed-upon single definition.
    Database schemas are one way to represent ontologies, but in general, ontologies can be far less restricted.

  * Dictionary-based ontology-like systems like the CIF standard defines concepts implicitly by their expressibility; 
    e.g., a structure is the sum of well-defined separate properties: lattice constants, species, positions, etc. 
    The standard may not explicitly give a name to the concept of a "structure," 
    but its definition becomes the implicit sum of the expressibility allowed by the dictionary keys.

  * This form of definition via expressibility seems analogous to how things presently are organized in our prototype ontology.
    Our formal definition of a material is now "Something that can be expressed by a materials model," and then we list materials models.
    A material is thus defined by the expressibility of the sum of our materials models.
    This is perhaps a desirable design as we go forward.
      
  * One of the things we are trying to do with our standardization effort is to build a foundation to express machine-representable relationships as a platform for translating between different application-specific ontologies (e.g., used for different databases)

  * To some degree, we may want to think about "data formats" as separate from the underlying ontologies.
    
    - Ontologies are more about semantics than representation.
    
    - Ontologies are sometimes explicitly connected to specific data formats and sometimes not.
    
    - Data formats typically have an ontology tied to them, such as CIF.

  * A related observation is that in data formats such as CIF, it is often a goal to unify data on a common format with restrictions to what variation of data representation can be used,
    e.g., a few or a single way to represent a crystal structure. 
    Depending on the goal with an ontology it may not be designed with the same desire, 
    but rather one may aim to define many related concepts and alternatives for representation.
    
    - We may want to consider where our effort is positioned in this. To standardize for integration between databases, we may want to be restrictive, 
      and accommodate the very wide range of alternative representations primarily via the definition of transformations to/from the ontology from other external ontologies (e.g., database-specific ontologies).

  * CIF has a concept of "composite material" that is different from ours; a composite of overlapping repeating lattices.
    We may want to consider adding this model and carefully consider naming in relation to our "Composite materials model."

- Discussion about the division in "homogenous" and "inhomogenous" materials models

  * Do we want to build this type of classifications into the "main tree" hierarchy, or not? 
  
    - Is there a point to adding extra steps in the "hierarchy of models"? Or, is there a desirable simplicity in keeping all specific materials models as the direct sublevel below "Materials model"? 
      
    - We can still have 'separate' classification concepts (e.g., entities) that we tie to the models, e.g., homogenous and inhomogenous, that would allow ontology-based reasoning on these concepts.

- A similar question about hierarchical representation is about the "single structure" materials model we presently have in the prototype ontology.
  This naming suggests a concept that encompasses many "submodels" that all fall under 'one structure.'
  
  * This may mostly be a naming thing in the prototype ontology. Our description relates more closely to "Single crystal," so perhaps we just need to rename "Single structure materials model" -> "Single crystal materials model."
  
  * We may want to branch out a few other models: Powder models? (Single material powder? Multiple materials powder?) Monolithed structures.
   
- Future

  - Consider renaming "Single structure materials model" -> "Single crystal materials model." However, this may need more discussion;
    what more exactly is "a structure" for us?
  
  - Consider adding more models of the kinds discussed above.

  - We have now had a series of explorative discussions of designs and concepts. 
    Next meeting, we may want to try to move over to more concretely discuss how to progress with the prototype ontology in terms of
    new entities (atoms, states, properties, ...) and materials model representations, e.g., pin down what "single structure" materials models 
    means in a larger degree of precision and maybe discuss representations of bulk materials with defects.

  - Next meeting will be at the end of January. Rickard sends a doodle.
