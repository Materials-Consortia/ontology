Meeting September 10, 2020
==========================

- The objective of the effort

  - As phrased right now: an ontology for materials databases.
  - Probably needs to be made more precise as we go along.
  - From the discussions we had this meeting, it seems there is some disagreement in view: should our aim primarily (only) be to further formalize e.g., specific structural definitions / materials models of relevance for the databases represented (i.e., start from our knowledge and needs), or should this ontology be a connection across "all" desired representations of materials?

- Discussion about the organization of the sub ontology in the repository

  - Do we need to define `material` at all? Can we exclude `material` and just have `materials model`?
  
    - There cannot be any *attributes* on the `material` level, so isn't it irrelevant?
    - However, if we are trying to connect concepts in different materials databases, attributes isn't the only relevant thing, but how they connect.
    - A biological model of a gene has Oxygen. Our structural models have Oxygen. It is the same Oxygen, and that is a connection.
    - It is difficult to see what harm the materials definition makes as a connection between materials models. 
      However, it is also difficult to see what benefit it provides.
      
  - For `material`: should we make a more formal definition as: *"A material is something that is described by a materials model"*?

    - A materials model is described by a specific set of parameters specifically tied to that model. Only things that can be described by materials models are materials.
      
    - However, the present statistical mechanics-based description of the material can be kept with an informal physical description of the concept.  
    
  - Some discussion about materials models
  
    - What makes the different materials models different? Do they have different attributes?; Yes?; all models have their own specific parameters.
    
    - We should have `compositional model` with a subclass `structural model`. Some of our present materials models relates to these.
    
    - Are all our present materials models actually materials models, or are they subclasses of materials? How should we organize this?

  - Removal of `structure`
  
    - We have `single structure materials model`. That is the same thing. Databases with a `structure` concept needs to connect that to our `structure materials model`.
    
- Future

  - More discussion needed to sort out more precisely the basic organization of the ontology; it is unclear if `Material` has a `Materials model` is the best way.

  - Rickard will schedule another meeting in ~ a month.

  - Rickard updates the GitHub stub ontology after what seems to be the current consensus.
  
  - We should create a list of links to relevant ontologies in the repository.
  
  - A few points to keep track of we did not get to this meeting:
  
    - Does the stub ontology organization fit into EMMO?
    
    - Can we formalize how we define entities in the ontology? (Based on what we decided for `material`: perhaps primarily as a mathematical/logical definition first, and with an informal physics description second). 
 
    - How does materials properties fit into what we have?
